    "### Advantages of Factorial Designs:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Test Interactions**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Interaction: Effect of one factor depends on level of another\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",

    "#### **3. Realistic**\n",
    "```\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Effects:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Main Effect**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Average effect of one factor across all levels of other factors\n",
    "\n",
    "Main effect of Light = \n",

    "```\n",
    "Effect of one factor changes at different levels of another\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple patterns:\n",
    "  No interaction: Parallel lines\n",
    "  Interaction: Non-parallel (crossing) lines\n",

    "## 🧱 Part 6: Blocking - Reducing Noise\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Blocking?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Blocking**: Group similar experimental units together, then randomize within blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Block?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Environmental gradients or natural variation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Field with gradient:\n",
    "North end: Shady, moist, fertile\n",
    "South end: Sunny, dry, poor soil\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Create blocks!\n",
    "```\n",
    "┌──────────────────┐\n",
    "│  Block 1 (North) │ ← Homogeneous\n",
    "│  C  T  C  T  C   │ ← Randomize within\n",
    "├──────────────────┤\n",
    "│  Block 2 (Mid)   │\n",
    "│  T  C  T  C  T   │\n",

    "│  Block 3 (South) │\n",
    "│  C  T  C  T  C   │\n",
    "└──────────────────┘\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Blocking:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Reduces Error Variance**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Without blocking:\n",
    "  Variance includes block differences\n",
    "  \n",
    "With blocking:\n",
    "  Variance only within-block\n",
    "  Block effect removed from error term\n",
    "  \n",
    "Result: MORE SENSITIVE to treatment effects!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Increases Statistical Power**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Lower error → Easier to detect real effects\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. More Representative**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Each treatment tested in all conditions\n",
    "Results apply broadly\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Blocking:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Use blocking when**:\n",
    "- Known source of variation exists\n",
    "- Environmental gradient present\n",
    "- Units come in natural groups\n",
    "- Time periods differ\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Don't block when**:\n",
    "- Units are homogeneous\n",
    "- No obvious grouping\n",
    "- Costs too much precision (too few units per block)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Blocking Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spatial**:\n",
    "- Location (north/south)\n",
    "- Elevation\n",
    "- Distance from edge\n",
    "\n",
    "**Temporal**:\n",
    "- Time of day\n",

    "## 🎓 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Principles of Experimental Design:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Three Pillars**: Replication, Randomization, Control  \n",
    "✅ **Replication**: Provides statistical power and estimates variability  \n",
    "✅ **Randomization**: Eliminates bias and distributes confounds  \n",
    "✅ **Control**: Establishes baseline for comparison  \n",
    "✅ **Blocking**: Reduces noise when variation is known  \n",
    "✅ **Factorial**: Tests interactions efficiently  \n",
    "✅ **Pseudoreplication**: Must avoid non-independent samples  \n",
    "✅ **Power Analysis**: Calculate n BEFORE collecting data  \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Design Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Define Question**\n",
    "- What exactly are you testing?\n",
    "- What's your hypothesis?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Choose Response Variable**\n",
    "- What will you measure?\n",
    "- Is it appropriate?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Identify Factors**\n",
    "- What's being manipulated?\n",
    "- How many levels?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Select Design**\n",
    "- CRD, RCBD, Factorial, etc.\n",
    "- Match design to question\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5: Power Analysis**\n",
    "- How many replicates needed?\n",
    "- Based on expected effect size\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 6: Randomize**\n",
    "- Generate random assignments\n",
    "- Document the scheme\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 7: Include Controls**\n",
    "- Negative control minimum\n",
    "- Consider positive/procedural\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 8: Plan Analysis**\n",
    "- Choose statistical test in advance\n",
    "- Prevents data dredging\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Mistakes to Avoid:\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **No control group**  \n",
    "❌ **Pseudoreplication** (treating non-independent samples as independent)  \n",
    "❌ **No randomization** (systematic assignment)  \n",
    "❌ **Too few replicates** (underpowered)  \n",
    "❌ **Confounded variables** (multiple things changing)  \n",
    "❌ **Post-hoc sample size** (calculating n after seeing data)  \n",
    "❌ **Data dredging** (testing many hypotheses after collecting data)  \n",
    "❌ **Ignoring known variation** (not blocking when you should)  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Golden Rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rule 1**: Design your experiment BEFORE collecting data  \n",
    "**Rule 2**: Randomize, randomize, randomize!  \n",
    "**Rule 3**: Always include a control group  \n",
    "**Rule 4**: Calculate required sample size with power analysis  \n",
    "**Rule 5**: Keep it as simple as possible (but no simpler)  \n",
    "**Rule 6**: Avoid pseudoreplication at all costs  \n",
    "**Rule 7**: Block when you know sources of variation  \n",
    "**Rule 8**: Document everything (especially randomization)  \n",
    "**Rule 9**: Consult a statistician BEFORE, not after!  \n",
    "**Rule 10**: If in doubt, add more replicates  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Quote to Remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *\"To call in the statistician after the experiment is done may be no more than asking him to perform a post-mortem examination: he may be able to say what the experiment died of.\"*  \n",
    "> — Sir Ronald A. Fisher\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Apply these principles**:\n",
    "- Design your own experiments\n",
    "- Critique published studies\n",
    "- Calculate power for your research\n",
    "- Use appropriate designs for your questions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Further Learning**:\n",
    "- Advanced designs (Latin square, crossover, etc.)\n",
    "- Mixed models for complex designs\n",
    "- Optimal experimental design theory\n",
    "- Bayesian experimental design\n",
