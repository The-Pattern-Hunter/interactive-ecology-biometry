## 📖 Overview

This unit explores how multiple species interact and coexist, forming ecological communities. Through the **Pattern Hunter Philosophy**, we'll discover species interactions, community structure, succession, and biodiversity patterns.

### Status: 🚧 **STARTING** - Building Interactive Notebooks

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, you will be able to:

1. Describe major **species interactions** (competition, predation, mutualism, etc.)
2. Understand **competitive exclusion** and **niche partitioning**
3. Analyze **community structure** and diversity
4. Calculate **species diversity indices** (Shannon, Simpson)
5. Explain **ecological succession** (primary and secondary)
6. Understand **keystone species** and their importance
7. Apply **island biogeography theory**
8. Analyze **food web stability** and complexity
