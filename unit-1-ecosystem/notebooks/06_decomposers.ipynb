    "\n",
    "### Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decomposers**: Organisms that break down dead organic matter (detritus) into simpler inorganic compounds, returning nutrients to the ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Critical Role:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without decomposers**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "❌ Dead organisms would accumulate\n",
    "❌ Nutrients locked in dead matter\n",
    "❌ No nutrient recycling\n",
    "❌ Producers would run out of nutrients\n",
    "❌ ECOSYSTEM COLLAPSE!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**With decomposers**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "✅ Dead matter broken down\n",
    "✅ Nutrients released back to soil/water\n",
    "✅ Producers absorb recycled nutrients\n",
    "✅ Energy flow continues\n",
    "✅ ECOSYSTEM THRIVES!\n",

    "## 🌡️ Part 4: Factors Affecting Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Temperature 🌡️\n",
    "\n",
    "**Effect**: Higher temperature → Faster decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why**:\n",
    "- Increases enzyme activity\n",
    "- Speeds up microbial metabolism\n",
    "- More bacterial/fungal growth\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimal range**: 25-35°C (77-95°F)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q₁₀ rule**: Decomposition rate doubles every 10°C increase\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**:\n",
    "- Tropical rainforest: Leaf litter gone in 6 months\n",
    "- Arctic tundra: Same leaf takes 5-7 years!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Moisture 💧\n",
    "\n",
    "**Effect**: Optimal moisture needed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Too dry**:\n",
    "- Decomposers inactive\n",
    "- Slow or stopped decomposition\n",
    "- Preservation (mummification)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Too wet**:\n",
    "- Anaerobic conditions\n",
    "- Slow decomposition\n",
    "- Methane production\n",
    "- Peat formation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimal**: 60-80% moisture\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Oxygen 🫁\n",
    "\n",
    "**Aerobic decomposition** (With O₂):\n",
    "```\n",
    "C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + ENERGY\n",
    "• Fast\n",
    "• Complete breakdown\n",
    "• No bad odors\n",
    "• Produces CO₂\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Anaerobic decomposition** (Without O₂):\n",
    "```\n",
    "C₆H₁₂O₆ → 3CO₂ + 3CH₄ + less energy\n",
    "• Slow (10-100x slower)\n",
    "• Incomplete breakdown\n",
    "• Foul odors\n",
    "• Produces methane (CH₄)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. pH 🧪\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimal range**: pH 6-8 (slightly acidic to neutral)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Too acidic (pH < 5)**:\n",
    "- Bacteria inhibited\n",
    "- Only fungi active\n",
    "- Slow decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "**Too alkaline (pH > 9)**:\n",
    "- Both bacteria and fungi inhibited\n",
    "- Very slow decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Nutrient Quality (C:N Ratio) ⚗️\n",

    "| **Wood** | 500:1 | Very slow |\n",
    "| **Paper** | 170:1 | Slow |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ideal C:N ratio**: 25-30:1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why C:N matters**:\n",
    "- Decomposers need N for proteins\n",
    "- High C:N (woody) → N limiting → Slow\n",
    "- Low C:N (fresh) → Fast breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Particle Size 📏\n",
    "\n",
    "**Smaller pieces → Faster decomposition**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why**:\n",
    "- More surface area\n",
    "- More access for decomposers\n",
    "- Easier to colonize\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "- Whole log: 50 years\n",
    "- Same log chopped: 10 years\n",
    "- Same wood as sawdust: 1 year\n",

    "- Natural recycling system\n",
    "- Remove dead biomass\n",
