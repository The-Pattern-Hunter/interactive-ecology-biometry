    "**Energy is THE fundamental currency of life**:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **All life requires energy** - No energy = No life  \n",
    "✅ **Energy flows one-way** - Sun → Heat (unlike nutrients which cycle)  \n",
    "✅ **Energy limits everything**:\n",
    "- Population size (carrying capacity)\n",
    "- Food chain length (max 4-5 levels)\n",
    "- Organism size and abundance\n",
    "- Ecosystem productivity\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Energy explains patterns**:\n",
    "- Why are there fewer predators than prey?\n",
    "- Why are top predators rare?\n",
    "- Why are ecosystems pyramidal?\n",
    "- Why does biodiversity vary globally?\n",

    "#### **First Law of Thermodynamics: Energy Conservation**\n",
    "\n",

    "**Example - Plant Energy Budget**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Sunlight absorbed (100%) = \n",
    "    Photosynthesis (1-5%) +\n",
    "    Heat (reflected/transmitted) (95-99%)\n",

    "    Respiration (60%) +\n",
    "    Waste (30%)\n",

    "\n",
    "**Statement**: *In every energy transformation, some energy is degraded to heat (increasing entropy). No process is 100% efficient.*\n",

    "- **Limits food chain length**: After 4-5 levels, not enough energy left\n",
    "- **Explains 10% rule**: ~90% lost as heat at each transfer\n",
    "- **Determines ecosystem structure**: Pyramidal, not random\n",
    "- **Predicts organism abundance**: Top predators rare, producers abundant\n",

    "\n",
    "**NPP varies globally**:\n",
    "- Highest: Tropical rainforest (2,200 g C/m²/yr)\n",
    "- Lowest: Desert/Tundra (~100 g C/m²/yr)\n",
    "- Pattern: Follows temperature + water\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trophic efficiency varies**:\n",
    "- Aquatic: ~16% (ectotherms, digestible food)\n",
    "- Terrestrial: ~10% (endotherms, tough plants)\n",
    "- But always <20% (thermodynamic limit)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Food chains**:\n",
    "- Typical: 3-4 levels\n",
    "- Maximum: 5 levels (aquatic)\n",
    "- Never: 6+ levels (insufficient energy)\n",

    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conservation**:\n",
    "- Protect NPP → supports all else\n",
    "- Top predators need huge areas (little energy)\n",
    "- Energy limits recovery rates\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agriculture**:\n",
    "- Eating plants >> eating meat (efficiency)\n",
    "- Each trophic level = 90% energy loss\n",
    "- Human diet affects planetary capacity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Climate Change**:\n",
    "- Alters NPP patterns\n",
    "- Shifts food web structure\n",
    "- Energy budgets change\n",

    "2. 📉 Energy decreases geometrically (10% rule)\n",
    "3. 🔺 Ecosystems are PYRAMIDAL (thermodynamic mandate)\n",
    "4. 🔥 Most energy → HEAT (2nd Law)\n",
    "5. 🌱 NPP determines everything downstream\n",
    "6. 🦁 Top predators rare (little energy left)\n",
