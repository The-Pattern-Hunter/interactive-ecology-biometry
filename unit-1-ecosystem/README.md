## 🌟 Key Concepts to Master

### Energy Flow (from Notebook 2):
```
☀️ Sun (100%)
    ↓
🌱 Producers (1%)
    ↓ (~10%)
🦗 Primary Consumers (0.1%)
    ↓ (~10%)
🐸 Secondary Consumers (0.01%)
    ↓ (~10%)
🦅 Tertiary Consumers (0.001%)
```

### The 10% Rule:
Only about 10% of energy transfers between trophic levels. The rest is:
- 🔥 Lost as heat (respiration) - 60%
- 💩 Undigested (waste) - 20%
- 🏃 Used for movement - 10%

### Biogeochemical Cycles (from Notebook 4):
- **Carbon**: Gaseous, climate change concern
- **Nitrogen**: Most complex (5 transformations)
- **Phosphorus**: Sedimentary, slowest, often limiting
- **Water**: Fastest, connects all other cycles

### Limiting Factors (from Notebook 5):
- **Liebig's Law**: Growth limited by scarcest resource
- **Shelford's Law**: Too little OR too much can limit
- **Q₁₀ Rule**: Metabolism doubles every 10°C
