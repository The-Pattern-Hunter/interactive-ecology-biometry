> \*"An ecosystem is more than just a collection of organisms—it's a living network of energy, matter, and interactions."\*



\## 📖 Overview



This unit explores how organisms interact with each other and their environment, forming complex ecological systems. Through the \*\*Pattern Hunter Philosophy\*\*, we'll discover how energy flows, matter cycles, and life organizes itself at different scales.

\## 🚀 Getting Started



\### Prerequisites:

Before starting Unit 1, we \*\*strongly recommend\*\* completing:

\- \*\*\[Unit 4: Biometry](../unit-4-biometry/)\*\* - Build statistical foundation



\### Why Start with Unit 4?

\- You'll need statistics to analyze ecological data

\- Learn how to interpret graphs and tables

\- Understand sampling methods for field work

\- Develop critical thinking about data



\### If You Skip Unit 4:

You can still learn Unit 1 concepts, but you may struggle with:

\- Interpreting energy flow data

\- Analyzing population data

\- Understanding ecological research papers

\## 🌟 Key Concepts to Master



\### Energy Flow:

```

☀️ Sun (100%)

&nbsp;   ↓

🌱 Producers (1%)

&nbsp;   ↓ (~10%)

🦗 Primary Consumers (0.1%)

&nbsp;   ↓ (~10%)

🐸 Secondary Consumers (0.01%)

&nbsp;   ↓ (~10%)

🦅 Tertiary Consumers (0.001%)

```



\### The 10% Rule:

Only about 10% of energy transfers between trophic levels. The rest is:

\- 🔥 Lost as heat (respiration)

\- 💩 Undigested (waste)

\- 🏃 Used for movement and metabolism



\### Why This Matters:

\- Explains why food chains are short (4-5 levels max)

\- Shows why predators are rare

\- Helps understand ecosystem productivity

\- Explains human food choices and sustainability
