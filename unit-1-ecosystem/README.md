## 🌟 Key Concepts to Master

### Energy Flow (from Notebook 2):
```
☀️ Sun (100%)
    ↓
🌱 Producers (1%)
    ↓ (~10%)
🦗 Primary Consumers (0.1%)
    ↓ (~10%)
🐸 Secondary Consumers (0.01%)
    ↓ (~10%)
🦅 Tertiary Consumers (0.001%)
```

### The 10% Rule:
Only about 10% of energy transfers between trophic levels. The rest is:
- 🔥 Lost as heat (respiration) - 60%
- 💩 Undigested (waste) - 20%
- 🏃 Used for movement - 10%

### Why This Matters:
- Explains why food chains are short (4-5 levels max)
- Shows why predators are rare
- Helps understand ecosystem productivity
- Explains human food choices and sustainability

### Pyramid Principles (from Notebook 3):
- **Numbers**: Can be inverted (1 tree supports 1000 insects)
- **Biomass**: Rarely inverted (oceans with fast phytoplankton turnover)
- **Energy**: NEVER inverted (thermodynamics!)
