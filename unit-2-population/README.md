# 🐾 Unit 2: Population Ecology

## Overview

This unit explores the dynamics of populations - how they grow, regulate, and interact with their environment. From exponential explosions to carrying capacity constraints, understand the mathematical models and biological principles that govern population change.

## 🎯 Key Concepts

### Population Growth

**Exponential Growth:**
```
dN/dt = rN
N(t) = N₀e^(rt)
```

**Logistic Growth:**
```
dN/dt = rN(1 - N/K)
```

Where:
- N = population size
- t = time
- r = intrinsic rate of increase
- K = carrying capacity

### Life History Strategies

| Strategy | r-selected | K-selected |
|----------|------------|------------|
| **Environment** | Unstable | Stable |
| **Reproduction** | Early, many offspring | Late, few offspring |
| **Parental care** | Low | High |
| **Size** | Small | Large |
| **Lifespan** | Short | Long |
| **Examples** | Insects, weeds | Elephants, whales |

### Survivorship Curves

- **Type I**: High survival until old age (humans, elephants)
- **Type II**: Constant mortality rate (birds, rodents)
- **Type III**: High early mortality (fish, plants)

## 🔬 Famous Studies & Examples

### Classic Population Studies

1. **Gause's Paramecium experiments** (1934)
   - Competitive exclusion
   - Carrying capacity demonstration

2. **Huffaker's mite experiments** (1958)
   - Predator-prey dynamics
   - Metapopulation concepts
