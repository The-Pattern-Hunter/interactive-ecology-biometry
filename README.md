### 🩺 Unit 4: Biometry - The Ecologist's Statistical Stethoscope ⭐ **COMPLETE**

**Status**: ✅ All interactive notebooks ready! **5/5 Complete**

Learn statistics through the **doctor-stethoscope analogy**: Just as doctors use stethoscopes to detect patterns in heartbeats, ecologists use statistical distributions to detect patterns in nature's data.

#### 📊 The 8 Distribution Filters:

Think of these as different "settings" on your statistical stethoscope:

1. **Binomial** - Success/failure events (seed germination)
2. **Poisson** - Rare events (species colonization)
3. **Normal** - Natural variation (plant heights)
4. **Uniform** - Equal probability (random sampling)
5. **Exponential** - Waiting times (time between events)
6. **Geometric** - Trials until success
7. **Negative Binomial** - Overdispersed counts (parasites)
8. **Log-Normal** - Multiplicative processes (population sizes)# 📚 \*\*Topics Covered:\*\*

# \## 🩺 The Pattern Hunter Philosophy

# 

# \### Core Principles

# 

# \*\*1. Patterns Before Formulas\*\*

# Students explore data and discover patterns \*before\* learning mathematical formulas.

# 

# \*\*2. Distribution-First Approach\*\*

# See the shape of data before calculating statistics.

# 

# \*\*3. The Stethoscope Analogy\*\*

# Statistics is a diagnostic instrument for understanding biological data.

# 

# \*\*4. Ecological Context\*\*

# Every statistical concept tied to real ecological examples.

# 

# \*\*5. Active Discovery\*\*

# Students manipulate visualizations and discover relationships themselves.

# 

# ---

# 

# \## 🚀 Quick Start

# 

# \### For Students:

# 

# 1\. \*\*Start with Unit 4\*\* (even if your course starts with Unit 1)

# &nbsp;  - You need statistical thinking to analyze ecological data

# &nbsp;  - Designed to be accessible to beginners

# 

# 2\. \*\*Launch the interactive tools\*\* (coming soon - under development)

# 

# 3\. \*\*Follow the 7-step Pattern Hunter journey\*\*

# 

# \### For Educators:

# 

# 1\. \*\*Review\*\* Unit 4 structure and philosophy

# 2\. \*\*Explore\*\* materials to see student experience

# 3\. \*\*Customize\*\* for your course (all CC BY 4.0)

# 4\. \*\*Use\*\* ready-made presentations

# \## 🛣️ Learning Pathways

# 

# \### Pathway 1: Pattern Hunter Recommended ⭐

# ```

# Unit 4 (Biometry) → Unit 1 → Unit 2 → Unit 3

# ```

# 

# Build statistical foundation first, then apply throughout ecology units.

# 

# \### Pathway 2: Traditional Course Order

# ```

# Unit 1 → Unit 2 → Unit 3 → Unit 4

# ```

# 

# Follow traditional ecology sequence, use Unit 4 as reference.

# 

# \### Pathway 3: Integrated Approach

# ```

# Unit 4 (Intro) → Unit 1 (with stats) → Unit 2 (with stats) → Unit 3 (with stats)

# ```

# 

# Learn statistics as you need it in each ecology unit.
