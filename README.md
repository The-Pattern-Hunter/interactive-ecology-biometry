# > \*"Learning ecology through pattern discovery and interactive exploration"\*

# 

# \## 📖 Overview

# 

# This repository contains interactive learning materials for a comprehensive ecology course, integrating statistical thinking (biometry) with ecological concepts. Based on the \*\*Pattern Hunter Philosophy\*\*, students discover patterns in data before learning formulas.

# 

# \## 🎯 Course Structure

# 

# \### \[Unit 1: Ecosystem and Applied Ecology](unit-1-ecosystem/)

# \*\*Status\*\*: 🚧 Coming Soon

# 

# Topics: Autecology and Synecology, Ecosystems, Food Chains, Energy Flow, Ecological Pyramids, Biogeochemical Cycles, Limiting Factors, Physical Factors

# 

# ---

# 

# \### \[Unit 2: Population Ecology](unit-2-population/)

# \*\*Status\*\*: 🚧 Coming Soon

# 

# Topics: Population Attributes, Life Tables, Survivorship Curves, Growth Models, r and K Strategies, Population Regulation, Interactions, Gause's Principle

# 

# ---

# 

# \### \[Unit 3: Community Ecology](unit-3-community/)

# \*\*Status\*\*: 🚧 Coming Soon

# 

# Topics: Community Characteristics, Species Diversity, Vertical Stratification, Ecotone, Ecological Succession, Climax Community Theories

# 

# ---

# 

# \### \[Unit 4: Biometry](unit-4-biometry/) ✨ \*\*NOW AVAILABLE\*\*

# \*\*Status\*\*: ✅ Complete and Interactive

# 

# The statistical foundation for understanding ecological data.

# 

# \*\*The Core Analogy:\*\* \*Just as a doctor uses a stethoscope to detect hidden patterns in heartbeats, ecologists use statistical distributions as their instrument to detect patterns in nature's data.\*

# 

# \#### What's Inside:

# 

# 📊 \*\*Interactive Tools:\*\*

# \- Main Stethoscope Explorer (7-step journey)

# \- Distribution Gallery (8 probability distributions)

# \- Central Tendency Visualizer

# \- Dispersion Calculator

# \- Sampling Simulator

# \- Hypothesis Testing Lab

# 

# 📚 \*\*Topics Covered:\*\*

# \- Biological Data Types

# \- Graphical Representation

# \- The 8 Probability Distributions

# \- Measures of Central Tendency

# \- Measures of Dispersion

# \- Sampling Techniques

# \- Hypothesis Testing

# 

# 🎮 \*\*Learning Features:\*\*

# \- Distribution-First Approach

# \- Pattern Hunter Philosophy

# \- Real ecological examples

# \- Hands-on exploration

# \## 🩺 The Pattern Hunter Philosophy

# 

# \### Core Principles

# 

# \*\*1. Patterns Before Formulas\*\*

# Students explore data and discover patterns \*before\* learning mathematical formulas.

# 

# \*\*2. Distribution-First Approach\*\*

# See the shape of data before calculating statistics.

# 

# \*\*3. The Stethoscope Analogy\*\*

# Statistics is a diagnostic instrument for understanding biological data.

# 

# \*\*4. Ecological Context\*\*

# Every statistical concept tied to real ecological examples.

# 

# \*\*5. Active Discovery\*\*

# Students manipulate visualizations and discover relationships themselves.

# 

# ---

# 

# \## 🚀 Quick Start

# 

# \### For Students:

# 

# 1\. \*\*Start with Unit 4\*\* (even if your course starts with Unit 1)

# &nbsp;  - You need statistical thinking to analyze ecological data

# &nbsp;  - Designed to be accessible to beginners

# 

# 2\. \*\*Launch the interactive tools\*\* (coming soon - under development)

# 

# 3\. \*\*Follow the 7-step Pattern Hunter journey\*\*

# 

# \### For Educators:

# 

# 1\. \*\*Review\*\* Unit 4 structure and philosophy

# 2\. \*\*Explore\*\* materials to see student experience

# 3\. \*\*Customize\*\* for your course (all CC BY 4.0)

# 4\. \*\*Use\*\* ready-made presentations

# \## 🛣️ Learning Pathways

# 

# \### Pathway 1: Pattern Hunter Recommended ⭐

# ```

# Unit 4 (Biometry) → Unit 1 → Unit 2 → Unit 3

# ```

# 

# Build statistical foundation first, then apply throughout ecology units.

# 

# \### Pathway 2: Traditional Course Order

# ```

# Unit 1 → Unit 2 → Unit 3 → Unit 4

# ```

# 

# Follow traditional ecology sequence, use Unit 4 as reference.

# 

# \### Pathway 3: Integrated Approach

# ```

# Unit 4 (Intro) → Unit 1 (with stats) → Unit 2 (with stats) → Unit 3 (with stats)

# ```

# 

# Learn statistics as you need it in each ecology unit.
